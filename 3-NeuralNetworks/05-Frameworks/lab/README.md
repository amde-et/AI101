# Classification with PyTorch/TensorFlow

Lab Assignment from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

Solve two classification problems using single and multi-layered fully-connected networks using PyTorch or TensorFlow:

1. **[Iris classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)** problem - an example of problem with tabular input data, which can be handled by classical machine learning. You goal would be to classify irises into 3 classes, based on 4 numeric parameters.
1. **MNIST** handwritten digit classification problem which we have seen before.

Try different network architectures to achieve the best accuracy you can get.
